          <p className="text-sm md:text-lg">TED, which stands for Technology, Entertainment, and Design, is a global platform dedicated to spreading ideas through short, powerful talks. It was founded in 1984 by Richard Saul Wurman and Harry Marks in Monterey, California. Originally conceived to converge these three fields, TED has since expanded to cover a vast array of topics including science, business, and global issues. Renowned for its high-quality speakers and thought-provoking content, TED inspires and informs millions around the world. </p>
